-Car Price Prediction with Ridge Regression
This project explores car price prediction using a cleaned and processed dataset of used cars. It applies machine learning 
techniques—specifically Ridge Regression—to forecast prices based on features like engine size, horsepower, mileage, and vehicle age.

-Key Features:
Cleaned and transformed raw car data (CSV format),
Visualized price distributions (before and after log transformation),
Engineered features such as vehicle age,
Implemented a Ridge Regression model using scikit-learn,
Evaluated predictions using RMSE and visual comparison plots

-Tech Stack:
Python,
Pandas, NumPy
Seaborn, Matplotlib,
scikit-learn (Ridge Regression)

-Goal:
To build a reliable regression model that can help estimate a car's resale value, aiding buyers, sellers, and dealerships in making informed decisions.
